# Dicee Game:


The Dicee Game is a simple web-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS). It leverages the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the web page based on user interactions. The interface consists of two dice images styled with CSS, a roll button, and JavaScript logic to handle the game's functionality. When the roll button is clicked, JS generates random numbers for each player's dice roll, compares the results, and displays a message announcing the winner using DOM manipulation.

# Drum Kit:


The Drum Kit is an interactive web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS), with the DOM serving as the backbone for user interaction. It features seven clickable buttons, styled using CSS, each representing a different drum sound. The application responds to user clicks or keyboard key presses, triggering corresponding drum sounds using JavaScript event listeners. Through DOM manipulation, the interface provides real-time feedback, allowing users to experiment with different drum sounds and create rhythmic patterns effortlessly.
